# Protocol Rules

## Addressing 
    - 10-bit address
    - Assigned in software (not baked in)
    - Can be location-based (e.g. first five MSBs correspond to x, last 5 correspond to y)

## Packet Structure
Standard: | 255 | Dest. | # Edges | Src. | # Bytes | Payload â€¦ | CRC |
ACK: | 254 | Dest. | # Edges | Src. | CRC
Buffer Depth: | Empty buffer space [0, 253] |

## Routing Rules

On Packet Received:
```swift
if packet is standard:
    if LUT does not already have source address:
        add entry to LUT
    if I am destination:
        process data in packet
    else:
        increment hop count
        if LUT has destination address:
            send packet to port which minimizes C(hops, buffer) = hops + \lambda*buffer over all ports
        else:
            send packet to all ports as standard flood
elseif packet is ack:
    if LUT does not already have source address:
        add entry to LUT
    if I am destination:
        process acknowledgement
    else:
        increment hop count
        if LUT has destination address:
            send packet to port which minimizes C(hops, buffer) = hops + \lambda*buffer over all ports
        else:
            send packet to all ports as ack flood
elseif packet is standard flood:
    if LUT does not already have source address:
        add entry to LUT
    if I am destination:
        process data in packet
    else:
        if I have seen this packet before:
            return
        increment hop count
        if LUT has destination address:
            send packet to port which minimizes C(hops, buffer) = hops + \lambda*buffer over all ports
        else:
            send packet to all ports
elseif packet is ack flood
    if LUT does not already have source address:
        add entry to LUT
    if I am destination:
        process acknowledgement
    else:
        if I have seen this packet before:
            return
        increment hop count
        if LUT has destination address:
            send packet to port which minimizes C(hops, buffer) = hops + \lambda*buffer over all ports
        else:
            send packet to all ports
else:
    write buffer depth to LUT
```

## Routing Table

The routing table (or lookup table, LUT) consists of rows of:
Port | Destination | Hopcount | Current port buffer size
This is different from standard Ethernet routing tables because it includes the current port buffer size as part of the table entry, allowing for a more robust cost function for use in the path planning algorithm.

## Buffer Depth Updates
Send buffer depth on all ports every q seconds, and every time a packet leaves or arrives
