## Working!

Currently:

### Jake
 - Hardware 0.1
 - Diagram Packet, Switching, Backpressure

### Nick
 - Evaluation Metrics (written into latex)
  - message delay time between two nodes
  - message delay time across switches (delay time relative # switches, should be linear)
  - message delay time with increasing crosstraffic (measure of success: if no increase in message time for additional crosstraffic, we are better than static-routing ethernet)

### Dougie
 - How does TCP/IP route?

### Patrick
 - Simulation Research
