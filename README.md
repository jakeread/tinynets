# Protocol Rules

## Addressing 
    - 10-bit address (1024 Unique in System)
    - Addresses are assigned in software (Ethernet: Hardware Addresses)
    - Can be location-based (e.g. first five MSBs correspond to x, last five correspond to y)

## Packet Structure

Type | 8 Bits | 10 Bits | 6 Bits | 10 Bits | 6 Bits | N Bytes | CRC 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
Standard: | 255 | Dest. | # Edges | Src. | # Bytes | Payload â€¦ | CRC |
ACK: | 254 | Dest. | # Edges | Src. | x | x| CRC
Buffer Depth: | [0 - 253] | x | x | x | x | x | x |

## Routing Rules

On Packet Received:
```swift

if hop count > max:
    kill packet

increment hop count

if packet is standard:
    if LUT does not already have source address:
        add entry to LUT
    if I am destination:
        process data in packet
    else:
        if LUT has destination address:
            send packet to port which minimizes C(hops, buffer) = hops + \lambda*buffer over all ports
        else:
            send packet to all ports as standard flood

elseif packet is ack:
    if LUT does not already have source address:
        add entry to LUT
    if I am destination:
        process acknowledgement, increment window
    else:
        increment hop count
        if LUT has destination address:
            send packet to port which minimizes C(hops, buffer) = hops + \lambda*buffer over all ports
        else:
            send packet to all ports as ack flood

elseif packet is standard flood:
    if LUT does not already have source address:
        add entry to LUT
    if I am destination:
        process data in packet
        open window for duplicate packet elimination
        check previous duplicates
    else:
        if LUT has destination address:
            send packet to port which minimizes C(hops, buffer) = hops + \lambda*buffer over all ports
        else:
            send packet to all ports

elseif packet is ack flood
    if LUT does not already have source address:
        add entry to LUT
    if I am destination:
        process acknowledgement, increment window
        open timer for duplicate ack elimination
        check previous duplicates
    else:
        if LUT has destination address:
            send packet to port which minimizes C(hops, buffer) = hops + \lambda*buffer over all ports
        else:
            send packet to all ports

else:
    write buffer depth to LUT

```

## Routing Table

The routing table (or lookup table, LUT) consists of rows of:
Port | Destination | Hopcount | Current port buffer size
This is different from standard Ethernet routing tables because it includes the current port buffer size as part of the table entry, allowing for a more robust cost function for use in the path planning algorithm.

## Buffer Depth Updates
Send buffer depth on all ports every q seconds, and every time a packet leaves or arrives
